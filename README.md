# Microevolution
This code will take a fasta file of a gene and mutate it into another gene. In addition, it should be able to count and print how many iterations of mutations it needed to do before becoming as close as possible to the desired final product. To run, type:
    python read_fasta.py [the name of the fasta file you wish to read in]
    
Microevolution also comes with the fasta files for gfp, a gene similar to gfp, a gene in the green spotted pufferfish, and a gene in arabidopsis.
